<h2>BIO</h2>
<p>
 Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. 

</p>

<p>He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time.

<p>
    While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass, and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.
